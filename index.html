  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nothing like migrating to a new blogging platform to get you in the mood
to write some new posts. Just switched from Wordpress to
<a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>.</p>

<p>You can find migration instructions a number of places, but the process was pretty straightforward for me.</p>

<ul>
<li>Exported published posts from wordpress</li>
<li>Updated xml export to include atom namespace that was missing</li>
<li>Used <a href="https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp">exitwp</a> to convert the export
into the markdown format. I did run into a <a href="https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp/issues/6">wrapping issue</a>.</li>
<li>Enabled comments on old posts with the following find and replace</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'> perl -pi -e 's/layout: post/layout: post\ncomments: true/g' *.markdown</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Saved images to source/images and updated posts with proper links</li>
<li>Deploy to github!</li>
<li>Update feedburner RSS feed location</li>
</ul>


<p>Now I just need to find a spell checker plugin!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://dwolla.com">Dwolla.com</a> is a new payment network. It makes it easy to
transfer money without the transaction fees charged by credit cards. Each
transaction over $10 is 25 cents, and those under $10 are free. I think this
has a lot of potential so I have been exploring ways to utilize their API.</p>

<p>To start I wrote a node.js module for their API that you can find at
<a href="https://github.com/nanek/node-dwolla">https://github.com/nanek/node-dwolla</a>.
In addition, I added Dwolla OAuth2 to the
<a href="https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth">everyauth</a> module to make it easy to
authenticate.</p>

<p>They have some interesting API methods that are not common to payment APIs.
You can view a user&#8217;s account transactions and balances (with permission of
course). They also integrate and expose a user&#8217;s contacts from various social
networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, to make it easy to send/request money
from friends.</p>

<p>Let me know if you build something cool or if you have a great idea that could
utilize their API.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Microsoft provides a Translator API that allows you to translate text from one
language into another. It provides up to 1000 transactions/month for free.
Google also provides a translation API, however has recently removed their
free tier. One the projects I am working on needed the ability to translate
text, so I wrote a node.js module for the Microsoft Translator API, which you
can find more about at
<a href="https://github.com/nanek/mstranslator">github.com/nanek/mstranslator</a>.</p>

<p>The API itself provides a good set of languages to choose from and it also can
provide the audio of the word being spoken.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently returned from a wonderful trip to Norway.  One tech thing that
stood out was that everywhere you go there they have portable card readers
that read cards with a chip or magnetic stripe.  Looking into it, the &#8220;chip&#8221;
is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV">EMV</a> technology adopted in Europe in
2005 due to security concerns.  Every single place I tried to use my non-chip
credit or debit card came with a puzzled look and the statement, &#8220;no chip?!&#8221;
Being a tech geek I definitely felt out of date.  You could tell by the way
they acted that they didn&#8217;t swipe cards very often, as everyone only uses the
chip there.</p>

<p>I remember when I applied for my first credit card, the American Express Blue
card, which I still have.  It came with a USB card reader and a chip in the
card to help secure online transactions.  I never used the card reader, but it
was the main reason I got the card, and that was back in 1999.  Unfortunately
that is not an EMV chip, so it doesn&#8217;t work in Europe.</p>

<p>Swipe cards, just like plain text account numbers lack any sort of security.
This is widely known, however we currently have a chicken/egg problem of not
many cards with chips and not many readers for these chips in the US.
<a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a> and other companies are making card readers
more accessible, however is still based upon fundamentally insecure swipe card
technology. Some say mobile payments, such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication">NFC</a> will provide a
more secure technology and are more practical to deploy in the US over EMV
technology.</p>

<p>Frankly, I don&#8217;t care too much what technology is used, however I would prefer
the option to choose a more secure credit/debit card.  Seems like there
shouldn&#8217;t be an issue supporting both.  Recently I just go a new ING Direct
MasterCard, that has no embossed numbers on the card.  In fact, all of the
account information such as my name and account number and expiration are
printed on the back.  It certainly looks cool, albeit almost fake, and it
won&#8217;t leave my CC number imprinted in my wallet, however im not sure it makes
it my account any more secure.  I guess they decided that no one makes card
imprints anymore.</p>

<p>Im looking forward to see some innovation in banking over the next year.
Seems like the market is poised for a shake-up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When starting out on your own, there a number of things you need to do based
on where you live.  Even with all of the resources on the internet, it can
still be a little confusing to determine what is needed as it varies based on
a number of factors.  As such, if you are starting a business, then be sure to
research what is required for your situation.</p>

<p>Here are the basic steps for becoming a sole proprietor in Arlington County,
Virginia.</p>

<ol>
<li>County - Business License ($30/fee, plus tax at end of year) from the Commissioner of Revenue</li>
<li>County - Home occupation permit (free) from the Commissioner of Revenue</li>
<li>File State Taxes at end of year</li>
<li><p>File Federal Taxes at end of year and complete tax estimates quarterly
Other steps, highly recommended:</p></li>
<li><p>New bank account to separate business income/expenses from personal accounts</p></li>
<li>Business Cards - <a href="http://about.me">about.me</a> provides free <a href="http://moo.com">moo</a> cards</li>
<li>Health Insurance - <a href="http://www.ehealthinsurance.com/">eHealthInsurance.com</a></li>
<li>Networking - <a href="http://meetup.com">meetup.com</a>
After this, you can look into creating a more complex business type, such as
an LLC and/or trademarking a business name and getting an
<a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98350,00.html">EIN</a> if
needed.  However if you are just looking to get started, it could be a simple
as that.  Let me know if you think im missing something.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>DonorsChoose.org is running a <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/hacking-%0Aeducation">contest</a> by opening up its data for analysis and use in innovative
applications.  They have provided data dumps for project, search, donation and
gift card data in large csv files.  There are a two free tools that I
recommend to quickly review this data.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/">Google Refine</a> allows you to filter
the data and identify data quality issues.  It also makes it very easy to
manipulate and transform the data any way you like.  Bulk replacements and
column transforms are two of its strengths.  Another cool feature is the
ability to template exports into different formats such as JSON.  Heres some
tips I found with working with the Donors Choose data.  First increase the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-%0Arefine/wiki/FaqAllocateMoreMemory">memory settings</a>.  Second, update the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/issues/detail?id=31#c6">facet limit
setting</a> to
something higher.  The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/">screencasts</a>
for Google Refine do a great job in demonstrating its use.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/fusiontables/">Google Fusion Tables</a> is good for
visualizing data in various ways like charts, maps, or timelines.  This tool
works better with data sets that are already cleaned up.  It takes some time
to load the data and process it, so it is best served for working with just a
slice of data that you would like to present for a specific purpose.  It does
have a 250mb limit per user and a 100mb limit per csv file.</p>

<p>So go ahead and start analyzing this data.  It is for a good cause and the
lucky contest winner will get to meet Steven Colbert!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last year, I created <a href="http://funddrive.appspot.com">Team Drive</a> on <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App
Engine</a>.  I wanted to learn about Google
App Engine (GAE) which is a hosting platform for python/java based
applications.</p>

<p>Team Drive is based on a site that Fabien built years ago to record donations
of items for a charity food drive.  Users from an organization are split into
separate teams, and then compete to see who can collect the most food items.
By adding this friendly team competition to a normal food drive, you can
increase the participation and results of the drive.</p>

<p>Building on GAE is quite different than traditional single server application
deployments.  Everything in App Engine forces you to think about how to scale
your application.  By placing constraints, such as a thirty second processing
limit per request, it forces you to think about approaching problems
differently than if you were writing this to run on a single server.</p>

<p>App Engine supports two types of authentication methods, Google Accounts and
OpenID.  If you want to leverage their session management you need to use one
of these.  For an site aimed at organizations, I didn&#8217;t want users to have to
create a google account or OpenID.  To work around this I implemented an
OpenID provider in the application.  Administrators could upload a list of
email addresses and a Team Drive OpenID would be created for each of these
users.  The users themselves don&#8217;t need to know that they are using OpenID, as
I only ask for their username and password.</p>

<p>Another example is for counting the number of items contributed by a person,
team, organization or type.  In a relational database you might just sum these
up on demand.  However using the Google datastore you generally store counts
on the object itself and increment this count on each update.  App Engine has
also provided an implementation of map/reduce that makes it easy to perform
operations such as sums or counts over large collections.</p>
