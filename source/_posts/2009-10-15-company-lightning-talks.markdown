I'm always searching for ways learn more.  I know a lot of smart people
working on interesting projects, however it is often difficult to keep up with
what others are working on.  This past June I organized [lightning
talk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk) presentations for my
company.   We had ten 5-minute presentations on various topics that we video
taped and posted to our internal SharePoint site.  I think it worked out
great.  Five minutes is just enough time to make a point or introduce a topic
to an audience without boring them if they are not interested.  If they are
interested they can always followup afterwards to find out more.  Lightning
talks typically take place at conferences and give an opportunity for
attendees to present to the larger audience, however I see no reason not to
use the format inside your company as well.

I'm looking forward to our next series of lightning talk presentations
tomorrow. I will be presenting on Cloud Computing in the Government.
