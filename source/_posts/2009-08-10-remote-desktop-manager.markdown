If you find yourself managing a number of Windows servers take a look at
[Royal TS 1.5.1](http://www.code4ward.net/main/RoyalTS/Download.aspx).

Royal TS allows you to organize your connections to multiple servers over RDP.
There are other programs that do this, but this one allows you to easily
categorize, sort and search the list.Â  It saves all of your settings in a XML,
which you can easily share with other co-workers as they join the project.

The latest version is shareware, however I use the freeware 1.5.1 version and
it works great!
