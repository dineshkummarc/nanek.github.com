So my trusty 1992 Buick did not pass the State Inspection this year.  Who knew
that the driver side power window needs to be fully operational?  Anyhow, to
make a short story shorter, I have decided not to fix my car (at least not
right now).

I would like to wait for an electric car to come out before buying a new one.
Perhaps a [Chevy Volt](http://www.chevrolet.com/electriccar/), or a possible
plug-in hybrid [Toyota
Prius](http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=126123), but
they seem to be at least a year or more out.

So until something changes, ill be depending a lot more on the metro system
for my daily commute to work.  Today I took the Metro Bus to Tysons Corner for
the first time.  It uses your SmartTrip card, runs frequently, was well
heated, and even announces and displays the next stop (like airport shuttles).
It does add a half an hour each way and I need to walk a little bit more, but
overall it is great.  Certainly much easier and convenient that I first
expected.

[WMATA ](http://www.wmata.com/)also updated their website today.  If you
haven't used it recently, check it out.  You can email trip itineraries to
yourself and there are also direct links to Google Maps walking directions.
