I recently completed the book, "[Life Inc.](http://rushkoff.com/books/life-incorporated/life-inc-distributors) How the world became a corporation and how to take it back," by [Douglas Rushkoff](http://rushkoff.com/).

The book tells the compelling history of how corporations have defined and
controlled the world since their inception.  It might make you rethink some
basic assumptions we have about how society has evolved the way that it has.
One example used in the book is the concept of having a large suburban home
while working in the city, being constructed by car companies to create a
market and the need for cars.  He ends the book with a call to action,
specifically mentioning creating local currencies and using Community
Supported Agriculture.  I've considered trying a
[CSA](http://www.localharvest.org/csa/) that would deliver to Arlington, but I
don't really cook that much.  He also mentions [Kiva.org](http://kiva.org)
which [I use and enjoy](http://techopener.com/blog/2009/06/kiva-now-allows-loans-to-people-in-the-us/).

Do you use a CSA?
