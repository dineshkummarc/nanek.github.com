[![jing-logo](/images/jing-logo.gif)](http://www.jingproject.com/)If you ever need to capture video of
your desktop with sound or take a bunch of quick screen shots, check out
[Jing](http://www.jingproject.com). Â It is free, easy to use and just works.
In the future I will be posing some screencasts of various products using this
tool.
