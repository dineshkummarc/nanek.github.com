Carbon emissions are a significant cause of global warming.  Therefore, each
of us needs to take responsibility in reducing our carbon footprint.  In order
to do this, we have to understand how much carbon we are using.
[Dopplr.com](http://dopplr.com) is a service for frequent travellers, that
primarily allows you to share your plans with other travellers.  However they
also calculate the carbon footprint of your flights.  As a technical
consultant there has been months where I have travelled week after week all
over the country.  As I become more and more aware of my personal impact I
continue to look for alternatives whether it be using web conferencing tools,
combining trips or recommending to work remotely.  I encourage you to track
your carbon footprint, and I highly recommend Dopplr to help you do so.

trips.
