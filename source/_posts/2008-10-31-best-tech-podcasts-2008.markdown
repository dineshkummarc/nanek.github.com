During my daily commute I listen to a number of podcasts on my iPod mini.  It
allows me to really keep up on a lot of different topics.  Below are my
favorite podcasts which I highly recommend:

  * [FLOSS Weekly](http://www.twit.tv/FLOSS) which talks about free and open source software with [Leo Laporte](http://leoville.com/) and [Randal Schwartz](http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/)
  * [Google Developer Podcast](http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleDeveloperPodcast) for developer interviews of some of the projects at Google
  * [Hanselminutes](http://hanselminutes.com/) where [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) covers in depth a wide range of Microsoft and other web technologies
I also frequently listen to and enjoy:

  * [this Week in Tech](http://www.twit.tv/twit) also by Leo Laporte
  * [Herding Code](http://herdingcode.com/) which covers .NET technologies
  * [Ruby on Rails Podcast](http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/) for the latest in Rails
If you recommend any other podcasts, please leave them in the comments!
