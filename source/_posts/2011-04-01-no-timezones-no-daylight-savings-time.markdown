Timezones and daylight savings time never really made sense to me.  How could
something as fundamental, precise and constant as time be dependent upon my
location or a local government?

Turns out, [Swatch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time) tried
to tackle this already.  [eBeats](http://ebeats.org/) is trying something
similar.  Until then, there is always [Every Time Zone](http://everytimezone.com/).
