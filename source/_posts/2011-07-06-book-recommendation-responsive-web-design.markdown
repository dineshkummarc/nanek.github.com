I just finished [Responsive Web Design](http://www.abookapart.com/products
/responsive-web-design) by Ethan Marcotte. It is a quick and entertaining
read. It brings together some CSS techniques you may already know and some you
probably don't to give clear solution to an ever increasing problem of dealing
with varying screen sizes. I look forward to using these strategies in my next
project and I highly recommend the book. Let me know if you want to borrow it.
