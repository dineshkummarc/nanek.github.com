My company provides me with a mobile phone, and we just switched carriers from
AT&T to Sprint.  Along with this, I got the [HTC Touch
Pro](http://www.htc.com/www/product.aspx?id=49518).  It has everything my old
HTC 8525 had including WiFi, a slide out keyboard, exchange integration, and a
touch screen.  Some new features include GPS, Windows Mobile 6, Sprint Music
and TV, and a slicker look and feel.

I immediately downloaded (which was super quick) and installed the following
windows mobile applications:

  * [Google Maps](http://www.google.com/mobile/winmo/) even includes street view now on the mobile and works great with integrated GPS.
  * [Qik](http://qik.com) does video streaming.  I have not used this before, but I hear good things and want to try it out.
  * [Yahoo! Go](http://mobile.yahoo.com/go)
I have not tried it yet, but at some point ill probably break down and buy
[WMWifiRouter](http://www.wmwifirouter.com/) as it sounds too useful when
traveling.  Also Windows Live Search was already installed, which has a great
Speak feature for searching.

What windows mobile apps do you recommend?  Oh wait, I forgot, everyone uses
the iPhone now!
