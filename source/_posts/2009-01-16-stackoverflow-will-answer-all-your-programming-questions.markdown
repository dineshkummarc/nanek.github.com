Lately I have been doing more .NET development and ultimately at some point
you get stuck, forget how to do something, or wonder what the best practices
for something is.  You immediately run a few google searches and get back some
articles on a bunch of weird answer sites.  Recently a new site for asking
questions started with a really good and unique design.  If you have not ran
across it already, I highly recommend taking a look.
[StackOverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) is a mix between wikis, blogs,
forums, and digg for programming questions and answers.  Even though it is
fairly new, it already has a great community and lots of content.  Many
languages and topics are covered even though the community, founders, and the
site itself are primarily .NET based.

They also run a great [blog and podcast](http://blog.stackoverflow.com) where
they talk about the site and how they developed it.  They are off to a great
start, and they are looking to start a similar site oriented towards [IT
Centric](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/coming-in-march-it-stack-overflow/) version soon.  These guys get it.
