Earlier this evening I attended a [Refresh DC](http://www.refresh-dc.org/)
event at [CDIA](http://www.cdiabu.com/overview/washington-campus.php).  [Paul
Annett](http://paulannett.co.uk/), design lead at
[Clearleft](http://clearleft.com/), gave a great presentation on how being
clever in web design can promote viral word of mouth marketing.   He gives
great examples of logos and websites that have intentionally and
unintentionally added subtle features/easter eggs that allow the user to
discover and share them.  Who knew FedEx had an arrow in its logo? Check out
the presentation below or on his site:
