You might be hoping for someone to invent a great new technology that will
stop climate change.  Unfortunately, in reality it is really up to you to
solve it.  Take a look at [10 Solutions for Climate
Change](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=10-solutions-for-
climate-change).  We don't need to invent new technology to stop climate
change.  Instead, we just need to change ourselves.
