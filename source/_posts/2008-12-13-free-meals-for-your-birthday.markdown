Today is my birthday and below are a few restuarants that I enjoy eating at
around this time.  If you sign up for thier newsletter they will email you a
certificate for a free meal around your birthday.

  * [Noodles and Company](http://noodle.fbmta.com/members/UpdateProfile.aspx?Action=Subscribe&InputSource=W)
  * [Red Robin](http://apps.fishbowl.com/a/redrobin/eclub/agegate.aspx)
  * [Gordon Biersch](http://www.gordonbiersch.com)
Afterwards top it off with a free ice cream from [Cold Stone
Creamery](http://www.coldstonecreamery.com/birthday/birthday_club.aspx).

You might get a few emails throughout the year with other advertisments, but
it is well worth it.
