Kiva.org allows you to make micro-loans to people in need. This is a great
example of how the social web can organize groups seeking a common goal. It is
pretty awesome when you can easily make a small loan of $25 with a group of
random people to help someone start or expand their business. If you haven't
tried it yet I encourage you to check it out. When I started using the site I
wondered why something like this was not available to people in the US. Well
now it is possible through Kiva. This service is a win-win for all involved
and I see this service growing dramatically over the next two years.
