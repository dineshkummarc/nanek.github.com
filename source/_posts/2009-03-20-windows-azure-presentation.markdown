Yesterday I went to the [Mid-Atlantic Cloud Computing user group](http://www.a
zureusergroup.com/group/midatlanticcloudcomputingusergroupmcc) in Reston, VA.
It's a newly formed group that plans to meet once a month.  The topic of the
evening was Windows Azure, in which Scott Zimmerman from Microsoft gave a
great overview of their online suite of products with a focus on the Compute
and Storage capabilities of Windows Azure.  I wont go into the topic right now
as the [presentation](http://blogs.msdn.com/zxue/archive/2009/03/20/mid-
atlantic-cloud-computing-ug-presentation.aspx) is available, but below are a
few interesting notes:

  * $500 million dollars invested for each data center
  * Half of all Exchange/SharePoint/Dynamic CRM revenue is expected to come from online service in the next 5 years
  * Everything is replicated at least 3 times
  * Currently runs .NET and C++.  Java/Ruby other languages coming soon
  * Visual Studio works with all of the services but is not required, everything is exposed through REST and SOAP
  * BizTalk Server 2009 can be used to help manage connections to the cloud
  * Declarative Fabric controller handles the deployment and configuration automatically
  * Community Tech Preview is currently free.  Service will be live by the end of 2009 with pricing plans
