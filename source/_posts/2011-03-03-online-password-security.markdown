I often find myself forgetting my passwords and usernames to various sites.
So recently, I decided to get serious about password management.  I use
[KeyPassX](http://www.keepassx.org/) (or KeyPass if you are using windows) as
a secure way to encrypt and record the urls, usernames and passwords to sites.

I also signed up for [Google 2 step verification](http://www.google.com/suppor
t/accounts/bin/static.py?hl=en&page=guide.cs&guide=1056283&topic=1056284).
This is useful for many reasons, but one in particular is that your gmail
account contains a lot of information that can be used to access your other
accounts.  Once you get past the initial setup, everything works seamlessly as
it did before.  Enterprises have traditionally paid big bucks to implement
this type of 2 factor authentication, typically requiring issuing RSA tokens
or similar to all employees.  It's great to see a more integrated solution
being provided directly to consumers.

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) has nothing to do with your password
security, however it is a great tool to sync files between your computer, web,
and devices.  So one way to always be sure that you don't lose your KeyPass
database or your Google verification backup codes is to place them in a
private dropbox folder that you can reach from everywhere.
