on where you live.  Even with all of the resources on the internet, it can
still be a little confusing to determine what is needed as it varies based on
a number of factors.  As such, if you are starting a business, then be sure to
research what is required for your situation.</p>

<p>Here are the basic steps for becoming a sole proprietor in Arlington County,
Virginia.</p>

<ol>
<li>County - Business License ($30/fee, plus tax at end of year) from the Commissioner of Revenue</li>
<li>County - Home occupation permit (free) from the Commissioner of Revenue</li>
<li>File State Taxes at end of year</li>
<li><p>File Federal Taxes at end of year and complete tax estimates quarterly
Other steps, highly recommended:</p></li>
<li><p>New bank account to separate business income/expenses from personal accounts</p></li>
<li>Business Cards - <a href="http://about.me">about.me</a> provides free <a href="http://moo.com">moo</a> cards</li>
<li>Health Insurance - <a href="http://www.ehealthinsurance.com/">eHealthInsurance.com</a></li>
<li>Networking - <a href="http://meetup.com">meetup.com</a>
After this, you can look into creating a more complex business type, such as
an LLC and/or trademarking a business name and getting an

needed.  However if you are just looking to get started, it could be a simple
as that.  Let me know if you think im missing something.</li>
