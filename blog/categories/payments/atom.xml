    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://dwolla.com">Dwolla.com</a> is a new payment network. It makes it easy to
transfer money without the transaction fees charged by credit cards. Each
transaction over $10 is 25 cents, and those under $10 are free. I think this
has a lot of potential so I have been exploring ways to utilize their API.</p>

<p>To start I wrote a node.js module for their API that you can find at
<a href="https://github.com/nanek/node-dwolla">https://github.com/nanek/node-dwolla</a>.
In addition, I added Dwolla OAuth2 to the
<a href="https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth">everyauth</a> module to make it easy to
authenticate.</p>

<p>They have some interesting API methods that are not common to payment APIs.
You can view a user's account transactions and balances (with permission of
course). They also integrate and expose a user's contacts from various social
networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, to make it easy to send/request money
from friends.</p>

<p>Let me know if you build something cool or if you have a great idea that could
utilize their API.</p>
