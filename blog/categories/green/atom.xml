<p>You might be hoping for someone to invent a great new technology that will
stop climate change.  Unfortunately, in reality it is really up to you to
solve it.  Take a look at <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=10-solutions-for-%0Aclimate-change">10 Solutions for Climate
Change</a>.  We don't need to invent new technology to stop climate
change.  Instead, we just need to change ourselves.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So my trusty 1992 Buick did not pass the State Inspection this year.  Who knew
that the driver side power window needs to be fully operational?  Anyhow, to
make a short story shorter, I have decided not to fix my car (at least not
right now).</p>

<p>I would like to wait for an electric car to come out before buying a new one.
Perhaps a <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/electriccar/">Chevy Volt</a>, or a possible
plug-in hybrid <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=126123">Toyota
Prius</a>, but
they seem to be at least a year or more out.</p>

<p>So until something changes, ill be depending a lot more on the metro system
for my daily commute to work.  Today I took the Metro Bus to Tysons Corner for
the first time.  It uses your SmartTrip card, runs frequently, was well
heated, and even announces and displays the next stop (like airport shuttles).
It does add a half an hour each way and I need to walk a little bit more, but
overall it is great.  Certainly much easier and convenient that I first
expected.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wmata.com/">WMATA </a>also updated their website today.  If you
haven't used it recently, check it out.  You can email trip itineraries to
yourself and there are also direct links to Google Maps walking directions.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Carbon emissions are a significant cause of global warming.  Therefore, each
of us needs to take responsibility in reducing our carbon footprint.  In order
to do this, we have to understand how much carbon we are using.
<a href="http://dopplr.com">Dopplr.com</a> is a service for frequent travellers, that
primarily allows you to share your plans with other travellers.  However they
also calculate the carbon footprint of your flights.  As a technical
consultant there has been months where I have travelled week after week all
over the country.  As I become more and more aware of my personal impact I
continue to look for alternatives whether it be using web conferencing tools,
combining trips or recommending to work remotely.  I encourage you to track
your carbon footprint, and I highly recommend Dopplr to help you do so.</p>

<p>Above is an screenshot from Dopplr showing the carbon footprint of some of my
trips.</p>
